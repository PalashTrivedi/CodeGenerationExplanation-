## Code generation and explanation with cohere API

    Code generation can be done by adding text to the prompt about the code you want to generate and thus leveraging the api     for 
           different small and medium models and tokens.   
Code explanation can be used to get an explanation of the code for understanding the syntax and what the code actually does as pe    r user input.

### Installation
  
- create `.env` file and add ``KEY=<your_api_key>``
